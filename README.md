# Hello world!

This is the official tech club of Delhi Private School, Sharjah, and we want you to be a part of our 
journey on your path to encoded heaven. We're excited that you're interested in joining our tech-savvy community dedicated to fostering individuals with a burning passion for technology, innovation, and creativity among high school students like you.

We aim to become a Tech club that transcends the generic high school club tendency to be nothing more than another addition to the college resumes of students but will remain with them as a memorable experience and inspire more students to take up Computer Science as a career path. We aim to foster creativity, ingenuity and teamwork among our fellow schoolmates through collaboration and the creation of innovative solutions to real-world problems.
